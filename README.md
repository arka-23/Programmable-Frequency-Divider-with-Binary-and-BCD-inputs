# Programmable-Frequency-Divider-with-Binary-and-BCD-inputs
This repository contains the design and simulation of a programmable frequency divider (50 % duty cycle)  using 
- Asynchronous decade down counter and 
- Asynchronous binary down counter 

by cascading modified MC 4316 and MC 4318 (4 bit) IC circuits designed as hierarchical blocks, which is fully functional with proper outputs.

Extended work:
â—¦ The above design is modified to give a 50% duty cycle when used as frequency divider circuit, coded using Verilog
HDL, and the counter circuit is simulated on a Basys 3 - Arctix 7 FPGA board to verify results.
